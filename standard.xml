They also can be in any order. Right now v1 is limitied to the following standards:

HTML5 : "html"
CSS3 : "css"
ECMAScript 2017 : "js"

What's in store for the future? We are planning on having HTJS-based Iframes, and JSON files. We don't really have this ready, but this a pretty good list of standards for use. Thanks!

    What's new in patch1? A minor update to the XML sheet allows more efficent processing of tags.
