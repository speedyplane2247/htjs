You can either put the full license, or the link to the license in the LICENSE button.
This is all HTML5, so you don't have to put the DOCTYPE tag either.

They also can be in any order. Right now v1 is limitied to the following standards:

HTML5 : "html"
CSS3 : "css"
ECMAScript 2017 : "js"

What's in store for the future? We are planning on having HTJS-based Iframes, and JSON files. We don't really have this ready, but this a pretty good list of standards for use. Thanks!
